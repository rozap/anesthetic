# Computer info
Computer is a WYSE N03D configured in BIOS (pw: Fireport) to always turn on when power is applied.

Network is set up static IP 192.168.66.5
Camera are also static @ 192.168.66.10, .11, .12, .13

Computer auto logins to an i3 (window manager) session that starts an ffplay instance to show cameras.

User is bsod:bsodracing, root pw is the same.

WM is i3 because tiling makes sense in this application. Default modifier is the Win key. https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_default_keybindings

Win+Shift+e exits.
Win+Shift+x powers off the machine RIGHT NOW. It does give ffmpeg a chance to shut down with a SIGINT.
Win+Enter spawns a terminal.

Autologin is done via systemd service as per https://vincent.bernat.ch/en/blog/2021-startx-systemd
tl;dr Added an auto login service at /etc/systemd/system/x11-autologin.service

on X startup, .xsessionrc runs ~/view-cams which is a dirty script that just continually runs ffplay to show the cams. Probably could be improved? Maybe https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/676251/bash-script-invoked-by-systemd-that-starts-gui-app
it also runs ~/record-cams, which is another dirty script that mounts /mnt/usb and dumps video to it. Should be a systemd service and we really should handle live-pulling the USB. At least it gracefully handles the device not being present on start.

camera IPs are configured in ~/cam-config.rc. This is read in .xsessionrc.

Shutdown is handled cleanly to avoid ffmpeg leaving broken partial segments on disk. 
1. Disabled HandlePowerKey in /etc/systemd/logind.conf
2. Installed acpid and wrote /etc/acpi/poweroff.sh and /etc/acpi/power
```
  root@x19:~# cat /etc/acpi/poweroff.sh 
  #!/bin/bash
  date >> tmp/poweroff
  echo "Waiting for ffmpeg." >> /tmp/poweroff
  ~bsod/abort-ffmpeg
  echo "Done. Powering off." >> /tmp/poweroff
  sleep 2
  systemctl poweroff

  root@x19:~# cat /etc/acpi/events/power
  event=button/power LNXPWRBN
  action=/etc/acpi/poweroff.sh "%e"
```
Edited i3 config at ~/.config/i3/config to override default poweroff behavior (else it just kills the session lol). This bypasses ACPID :( thanks i3.
